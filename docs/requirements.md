# The TimeFlo Project: Requirements Document
*Andrew Free 2021*

(*Thanks to Chris Gilmore for the document template for this
document.*)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create software to help a user manage time by implmenting a technique developed by Francesco Cirilo.

### Purpose and Scope

The technique breaks down work intervals into small 25 min segments followed by 5-10 min breaks. After completing at least 3 of these work/break intervals a 20-30 min break should be taken. The goal of this software is to help force the user to take breaks and break out of their flow state (also to get into the flow state).
This is useful in development as it can be easy to get stuck in a flow state while working leading you to dig into the weeds and loose the bigger picture.

### Target Audience

The target audience is myself although the software should be useable and easy to setup/run for anyone else who whishes to use it.

### Terms and Definitions

*Define any terms or acronyms you will be using in the remainder of this
document.*

## Product Overview

The project will be written in Python. It will use either a Qt GUI for the timer or a webpage (undecided). The software should be easy to set up and use for anyone wishing to utilize it. 

*Give a high level description of the functionality of the project here.
Describe the purpose of this section. It may be useful to give your
definition of a user, a stake holder and a use case. If there are scope
limitations to the project, i.e. things you will not be doing, or are
not required to do, this is a good section to put those.*

### Use cases

Use cases can be anytime you are working on a bigger project and need some software to help you both get into and out of the flow state. In development you want to be able to get into a flow state while working but also have time set to break out and allow yourself to see the bigger picture / give yourself a chance to take a break.

## Functional Requirements

*Describe the purpose of this section and outline its contents. Only a
few sentences are expected here. It may help to define a functional
requirement.*

### *Functional Requirements 1*

*Describe the first functional requirement. This is the meat of the
document, so be sure to use precise language. Include diagrams when
appropriate. Break this into a list of sub-requirements as needed.*

### *Functional Requirement 2*

*Etc.*

## Extra-functional Requirements

*Describe the purpose of this section and outline its contents. Only a
few sentences are expected here. It may help to define a nonfunctional
requirement.*

### *Extra-functional Requirement 1*

*Describe the first nonfunctional requirement. This is the meat of the
document, so be sure to use precise language. Include diagrams when
appropriate.*

### *Extra-functional Requirement 2*

*Etc.*
